****************************************************************************************
Start => Supervisor Agent (Rejected if invalid question) => Tools Expert Agent => Collection of Tools Experts (Agents) => Output Format Expert Agent => Supervisor Agent => Complete

Supervisor Agent Description
****************************************************************************************
* AI is Cloud Security and Cyber Security subject matter expert able to analyze & classifiy valid requests and rejects invalid requests.
* Log the input request -new feature, centralized logging with standardized fieldsets clearly indicating the agent/expert-agent, timestamp, user (use "rick" as default for now), action, input, output, and anything else would be helpful in json format
* Run input guardrails routine - Shown in "Example Guardrails Disposition"
* Analyze & Classify w/Standardized - Shown in "Output Example Classification"
* If valid_cs_question: false or input guardrails fail, reject the request.

After Output Format Expert
* Looking at the original question, take the formated output from Output Format Expert step and add any additional relivent information that might help beyond what whas included in the tools analysis.
* Summarize any errors collecting infomation from tools that might indicate a lack of visibility
* Run output guardrail routine
* Log final response delivered and disposition in the standard logging format

Best Tools Agent Description
****************************************************************************************
* AI is Cloud Security and Cyber Security subject matter expert
* Able to take Classification data from the Supervisor Agent and using tools.csv decide which tools which would be most useful to use to answer the input question
* Call the applicable Collection of Tools Experts, collecting the output for all of the subagent calls
* When all subagent return data or timeout hit, log request for best tools agent run, and pass all tools output data to Output Format Expert
* Log progress of in agent logging in the standard logging format

Output Format Expert Agent Description
****************************************************************************************
* AI is Cloud Security and Cyber Security subject matter expert
* Analyze the input question and use the output from all of the tools from previous steps (and only the output from the tools) to generate the most useful output for the question asked.
* Log progress of in agent logging in the standard logging format
* Summarized & formatted output is passed back to the Supervisor Agent
